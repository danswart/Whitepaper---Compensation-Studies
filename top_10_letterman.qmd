**Number 10:**
The consultant who wrote it can't name three streets in your city — but they
just told you how to spend $2.3 million of your residents' money.

**Number 9:**
The study compared your Police Chief, who manages 45 officers, to San Antonio's,
who commands 2,000 — and concluded you're "below market."

**Number 8:**
It includes the phrase "professional judgment" — which is consultant-speak for
"we changed the numbers but we're not going to tell you where or why."

**Number 7:**
Your benefits package is worth $2,000 more per employee than the regional
average — but the study called it "slightly ahead" and never converted it to
dollars.

**Number 6:**
Seventy-seven percent of your workforce was found to be "below market" — which
is what happens when you benchmark a city of 40,000 against a city of 1.5
million.

**Number 5:**
The study recommends the same solution for every position — more money — whether
you have 200 applicants or 2.

**Number 4:**
It contains no turnover data, no exit interview data, no vacancy data, and no
time-to-fill data — but it's very confident about what the problem is.

**Number 3:**
If you gave the study to a different analyst and asked them to verify the
conclusions, they couldn't — because the underlying data isn't in it.

**Number 2:**
Every city in your region has commissioned the same study, implemented the same
recommendations, and moved to the same 50th percentile — which moved the 50th
percentile — which is why you need another study.

You are about to make a multi-million-dollar *permanent* spending commitment
based on a seven-page document, and nobody in the room can answer the question:
